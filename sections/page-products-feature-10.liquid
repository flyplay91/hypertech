                <div class="cardcontainer">
                    <p>Max Energy Power Tuning extracts every bit of energy possible out of every molecule of fuel giving you more miles at part-throttle and more power at wide-open throttle. In order to increase engine efficiency, horsepower and torque, our engineers first make hundreds of dyno runs to optimize the spark and air-fuel curves point by point over the entire rpm band from just off idle to wide open throttle. Next we take the vehicle with the new tune to the track and the street to verify real world performance gains. The results…maximum power, quicker acceleration, smoother shifting and better driveability.</p>

                    <p>The Max Energy Sport not only gives you the power you crave but also offers specific features for your make, model and year.

                        <p>
                        Higher compression ratio engines and engines with superchargers or turbo chargers were designed to use only premium octane, so only one (1) Power Tuning program for premium octane is provided. But, if your car or truck came from the factory capable of using more economical regular octane, then two (2) optimized tuning programs are provided: one for premium, and the other for regular. In most cases, Hypertech’s exclusive Power Tuning for regular octane provides excellent power gains, almost as much power as premium octane. If you are using premium octane, and you want all-out, maximum power, then select premium octane Power Tuning.

                        <h3>V-TEC Controller</h3>   

                        <p>Some Honda and Acura vehicles have engines that are equipped with Honda¹s VTEC camshaft technology. Under certain driving conditions, specifically higher RPMs and heavy load, the engine controller engages additional camshaft followers which use a more aggressive camshaft profile. This increases airflow in and out of the engine which increases power output. The Max Energy Sport Power Programmer allows you to adjust the specific engine speed that the VTEC camshaft profile engages to customize the power band of your engine to match the power gains of the Max Energy Power Tuning and any additional bolt-on power adders.</p>

                        <p>Automobile manufacturers limit a vehicle’s top-speed to match the speed rating of the factory-installed tires. If you have installed tires that have a different speed rating, the Max Energy allows you to raise or lower the vehicle’s top-speed limiter to match the speed rating of the newly installed tires. A tire’s speed rating for maximum safe speed under perfect conditions is marked on its sidewall. Always obey all traffic laws when driving and only use this feature for off-highway competition in sanctioned events.</p>

                        <p>For improved fuel economy, vehicle manufacturers have developed V4/V8 modes. Chrysler & Dodge vehicles use the Multi-Displacement System (MDS) and GM has the Active Fuel Management System (AFM). These systems allow the engine to turn into a fuel sipping 4-cylinder during light load conditions such as steady speed cruising. We perfected the engine efficiency in V4 mode for both regular and premium octane. These systems have major benefits in fuel economy, but with a sacrifice in drivability when in V4 mode, and during the transition to V8 mode. The Max Energy allows you to adjust the minimum speed at which the V4 mode activates. Adjusting the minimum speed higher would prevent the V4 mode from activating while the road noise is low and V4 exhaust note is noticeable. Activating at a higher speed would allow for full benefit of the Max Energy 2.0 engine tuning in V4 and V8 mode at those higher speeds where the exhaust sound isn’t as noticeable. The V4/V8 mode can also be disabled completely as well.</p>

                        <p>In today’s vehicles, the onboard computer controls maximum engine rpm. The stock computer is programmed to shut down the engine when it reaches its redline. But if you have modified your vehicle to increase its high-speed performance, more rpm means more power. When you shift gears with the stock rpm limit, the engine falls back to below the peak of its horsepower curve. When you extend the engine’s rpm range with the Max Energy Power Programmer, your engine has more power available after gear changes. By adjusting the maximum rpm to keep the engine in the “sweet spot” of its power curve, you can increase the average horsepower that accelerates the vehicle.</p>
