We perfected the engine efficiency in V4 mode for both regular and premium octane. These systems have major benefits in fuel economy, but with a sacrifice in drivability when in V4 mode, and during the transition to V8 mode. The Max Energy allows you to adjust the minimum speed at which the V4 mode activates. Adjusting the minimum speed higher would prevent the V4 mode from activating while the road noise is low and V4 exhaust note is noticeable. Activating at a higher speed would allow for full benefit of the Max Energy 2.0 engine tuning in V4 and V8 mode at those higher speeds where the exhaust sound isn’t as noticeable.

These kits are designed with heavy duty, quad-layer nylon straps built to handle the shock of your RZR’s unsprung weight when jumping or speeding over rough terrain. Designed and made in the USA, the Hypertech Powersports limit straps fit all years of the Polaris RZR XP\/XP4 Turbo, XP\/XP4 1000, RS1, and S 900. All necessary hardware and instructions are included with the kit.<br><br>\n      Suspension travel limit straps are a crucial part of your RZR’s suspension setup. The factory suspension only limits down-travel when the stock shocks reach their mechanical limit at full extension. The weight of your wheels and tires extending quickly during a jump, or repeatedly over high speed rough terrain can damage the suspension components if left to hit the mechanical limits over and over. At full extension, the CV axle angle is at its maximum degree of deflection which can shorten the life of the CV axle and possibly lead to damage. Incorporating a set of Hypertech Powersports limit straps prevents damage to the suspension and drivetrain components by not only shortening the maximum extension of the suspension, but by also softening the blow when reaching full extension.<\/p>\n    <\/div>\n<br><br>\n    <div class=\"button-accessory\">\n      <a href=\"https:\/\/hypertech.com\/products\/spectrum-powersports-accessories-3001000\">BUY FRONT<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/hypertech.com\/products\/spectrum-powersports-accessories-3001001\">BUY REAR<\/a>\n    <\/div>\n  <\/div>"
