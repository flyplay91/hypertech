        <p style="color:black;">These settings allow you to customize the power delivery to how you want it, and on properly equipped vehicles you can tailor these settings per drive mode. The HYPER-MILEAGE setting is a very aggressive reduction in power delivery compared to the factory settings to help squeeze the most out of your fuel mileage. The MILEAGE setting steps power back modestly for a balance between economy and power. The STOCK setting makes no changes to the throttle response. The STREET setting greatly improves power delivery for improved drivability for everyday performance. Stepping up to the SPORT setting offers quicker throttle response that delivers power much quicker than the factory settings, and really wakes up the power. The PERFORMANCE setting offers an aggressive throttle response which balances drivability and power. The TRACK setting may take some getting used to because the power delivery is very aggressive and unleashes power that you never knew your vehicle had!</p>
        <p style="color:black;">Trucks and SUVs will also get the TOW setting that increases the throttle response for additional power during take-off and maintaining speed up hills to minimize downshifting which is just what you need when you're towing or hauling heavy loads.</p>
